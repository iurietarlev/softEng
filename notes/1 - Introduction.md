# 1 - Introduction

Modern software development teams work using **agile, iterative** methods, to revise and refine the design of the sofrware constanly as they **add new features**, **fix bugs**, etc.

## Design Definition

Design - is a matter of **organising** and **re-organising code** in order to solve problems and avoid future problems.

Design - [one of the three values of software](https://blog.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-three-values-of-software) (the other two being features and feedback).
Without design the marginal cost of adding a new feature will gradually increase until it becomes too hard to add anything new. Every application is a collection of code and the code's arrangement is the design (Sandi Metz).
Part of the difficulty of design is that every problem has two components. you must not only write code for the feature you plan to deliver today, you must also create code that is amenable to being changed later (Sani Metz).

## Four Elements of Simple Design

Four elements of simple design (J.B. Rainsberger):\

1. Behaves Correctly (passes all tests)
2. Minimises Duplication
3. Maximises Clarity
4. Has fewer elements

Minimising duplication helps to make the design more maintainable and hence more robust. If code is duplicated, then making a change to it may mean making the same change in multiple places, which is more work than we would like.
By aiming to maximise clarity, we work to improve comprehension of the design by humans. Reducing number of elements, helps make the overall size of the system smaller, making it simpler and easier to comprehend.
